- You can see the whole reef in another window.
- Users can edit a coral with a passphrase, which loads up a location, which is a coordinate on the reef.
    Or they can enter a coordinate and type in a passphrase. If it isn't already taken.
- The location is saved every 1 minute of use after moving. 
    Doesn't save if left alone. Doesn't change if in background.

- Need to balance growth with death.
- Get more coral / food / fish when you answer questions right.

- Add second layer of fish that generate on coral, total number is based on how much coral youhave.
- Fish poop out food.

- Initial image will be a real, dead coral reef!

- The whole thing resets every ... ? Or maybe grows to different reefs?

- Make the outside edges copies of the neighboring corals, but don't modify those, but do react to them!

- Add years of growth on the side.




As you drive around you damage.
Drive around to gain enhancements.
